# Introduction


## Hello, my name is Alex King.

### Mellow | Adventurous | Compassionate



One of my favorite pass times is reading and learning about new topics. I'm particularly interested in learning about topics that cross genres and apply well to multiple ventures. For example, I love learning about and practicing my communication skills because it is a valuable skillset to have no matter what I do in life. To be able to clearly communicate my thoughts and opinions through speech or text will always be helpful. I enjoy having conversations about deep topics such as belief systems, values, happiness, philosophy, and how it can all apply to living a more meaningful life.
